# Hello! I'm Koa.

I am a web developer with particular interest in lightweight micro-sites compatible with featurephones and Kai OS. I blog here and also tinker, so please ignore any messes, test posts or out of place features for now. Take a look around and feel free to contact me with any questions or inquiries.

# About this site
This website is made with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and a handful of plugins. It uses no pre-built boilerplate, CSS library and no Javascript other than what makes Eleventy tick. You can comfortably consume the site's content at tiny resolutions such as 240 x 320 for Kai OS featurephones. Readability is maintained down to around 144px and also scales up comfortably on any larger device. It's blazing fast and should run quickly on even the most basic of devices.

### Koa / Shem?
You might find links to projects/pages by "ShemTheDev" on various places around the net. Koa Brook and ShemTheDev are one and the same person- Koa is used for writing and personal projects whereas Shem is used more in a professional environment. I enjoy having a degree of separation between my work and my personal life. I am not offended by either name so feel free to refer to me as you please. Thank you for understanding!
