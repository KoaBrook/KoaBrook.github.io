    <p>A hundred million new internet users are coming online in the developing world thanks to the advent of low-cost, internet-connected featurephones such as those running on KaiOS. For the first time ever, users are taking their first steps into the internet on screens as limited as 240 x 320 resolution. Unfortunately their browsing experience will be marred by <a href="https://dev.to/shemthedev/is-the-future-of-the-web-text-centric-3ck9">biased standards</a> of the modern web. As a kind of tribute, I want to highlight five excellent examples of developer websites whose designs scale perfectly down to minimal screen sizes.</p>
<h3><a href="https://whizzoe.com/">Zoe Chew: whizzoe.com</a></h3>

<p>Zoe's website is the pinnacle of a modern developer website. Taking a single-column approach, her website scales flawlessly down to our minimum resolution without a single thing out of alignment and not a pixel of horizontal scroll is needed. A text-first, image-lite experience means that loading is lightning fast and there is plenty of content to consume on the homepage alone.</p>

<h3><a href="https://francoscarpa.com/">Franco Scarpa: francoscarpa.com</a></h3>

<p>Franco's site is as minimal and text-centric as it gets with a uniquely vibrant colour scheme, darkmode toggle and fully responsive design. Franco's website loads lightning fast and is <strong>user experience first</strong> with no tracking cookies, analytics or third-party integrations.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.lyndseyscott.com/">Lyndsey Scott</a></h3>

<p>Lyndsey is rightfully a legend around these parts and her website is nothing short of cosmic. It's a much more maximalist style with plenty of media content and fancy animations that somehow renders absolutely perfectly down to our minimal screen resolution. Not a pixel is out of place on any page even at a tiny screen size!</p>

<p>Do you know any developer websites which adapt perfectly to minimal screen sizes?</p>
