<h1>Hello! I'm Koa.</h1>
<p>I am a web developer with particular interest in lightweight micro-sites compatible with featurephones and Kai OS. I blog here and also tinker, so please ignore any messes, test posts or out of place features for now. Take a look around and feel free to contact me with any questions or inquiries.</p>
<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>This website is made with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> and a handful of plugins. It uses no pre-built boilerplate, CSS library and no Javascript other than what makes Eleventy tick. You can comfortably consume the site's content at tiny resolutions such as 240 x 320 for Kai OS featurephones. Readability is maintained down to around 144px and also scales up comfortably on any larger device. It's blazing fast and should run quickly on even the most basic of devices.</p>
